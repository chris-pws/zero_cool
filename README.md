# opi_zero_fan_controller

Given that the Orange Pi Zero gets very hot when using all four cores and on-board wifi for any sustained period of time, I decided to create a fan controller that minimizes fan noise and respects the integrity of the wireless signal with respect to EMF noise. In keeping with the compact form factor of the Zero, this board shall mate securely with the SBC and cooling fan, and provide ready access to the H2+'s additional USB ports.
